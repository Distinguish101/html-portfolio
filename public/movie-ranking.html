<h1>My top 3 animes watched this year (2025)</h1>
<h2>To qualify I must have seen at least one full episode this year.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Blue Lock S2</h3>
<p>
The final episode was all I have been waiting for!!. Nagi & Isagi's goal, Shidou's bicycle, Rin's flow, the genius that is Sae!!
</p>
<h3>Dandadan</h3>
<p>
Very good anime. I like its quirkiness and how they make it deep sometimes. Left us on a cliffhanger though :(
</p>
<h3>Vinland Saga S1 & S2</h3>
<p>
Very beautiful animation. The character development is top tier, we literally see it happen. 
Crazy good fights in S1. Lovely animated scenes too. <br >
I havent finished season 2 yet.
